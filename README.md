**Overview**
Overview
The Java program is a basic calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Swing framework. The calculator allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

**Key Components**
Calculator Class: Extends JFrame and implements ActionListener to handle user interactions.

GUI Elements:

JTextField: Displays the input and results.
JButton: Represents numeric (0-9) and operation (+, -, *, /, %, =) buttons.
JPanel: Organizes buttons into a clear layout.
Layout:

The layout uses BorderLayout to position components.
The buttons are grouped in panels for numbers, operations, and clearing.

**Functionality**
Action Handling: When a button is pressed, the corresponding action (e.g., appending a digit, performing an operation) is triggered.

Arithmetic Operations: Supports basic calculations and handles division by zero with an error message.

Clear Function: Resets the calculator for new input.

**Conclusion**
This simple calculator demonstrates basic GUI programming in Java using Swing, with essential arithmetic operations and error handling in a compact layout.
