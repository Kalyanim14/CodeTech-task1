**Overview**
Class Definition and Inheritance:

The program defines a Calculator class that extends JFrame and implements the ActionListener interface. This allows the class to create a window and handle user input events like button clicks.
User Interface Components:

JTextField: Used to display the input numbers and results. It's placed at the top of the window and configured to be non-editable by the user directly to ensure inputs are controlled by button presses.
JButton: Represents each calculator button (digits 0-9 and operations like +, -, *, /, %, =). The buttons are grouped into panels for better layout management.
JPanel: Used to organize buttons into logical groups:
nPanel holds the text field.
numberPanel contains the digit buttons.
operationPanel contains the arithmetic operation buttons.
sPanel contains the clear button.
Layout and Design:

The calculator layout is managed using BorderLayout, dividing the window into different regions:
NORTH: Contains the display (JTextField).
CENTER: Contains the digit buttons.
EAST: Contains the operation buttons.
SOUTH: Contains the clear button.
Each button has a consistent font size and color scheme, with numeric buttons in dark gray and operation buttons in blue.
Action Handling:

The Calculator class implements ActionListener, allowing it to handle events generated by button presses.
When a button is pressed, the actionPerformed method is called, determining the action based on the button label:
If a digit button is pressed, its value is appended to the text field.
If an operation button (+, -, *, /, %) is pressed, the first number is stored, and the operation is recorded.
The = button triggers the calculation based on the stored operation and the second number.
The Clear button resets the text field for new input.
Arithmetic Operations:

The program supports basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
It includes error handling for division by zero, where an error message is displayed if such an operation is attempted.
Execution:

The program's entry point is the main method, which creates an instance of the Calculator class, thereby displaying the calculator window.
Key Features
Basic Arithmetic: Users can perform standard operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
User-Friendly GUI: The calculator has an intuitive layout, with clear buttons and a large display for easy interaction.
Error Handling: Specifically for division by zero, the program prevents crashes by displaying a warning.
Clear Button: Allows users to reset the calculator to its default state without restarting the program.
Conclusion
This simple calculator program serves as a basic example of using Java's Swing framework to create a functional and visually appealing desktop application. It demonstrates handling GUI events, layout management, and basic arithmetic operations in Java.
